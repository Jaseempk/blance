    description2:
      "Text to pay, also known as SMS (Short Messaging Service) payment, is a payment solution that allows consumers to make a payment via texting on their smartphones. With this payment method, your customers send out a text to their client's phone stating they can make a payment and have the option to text back “yes” to complete the transaction. The business will have their client's payment information on file so they don’t have to worry about typing in their credit card information each time. If the business does not have their payment information available, there is an option for the client to add their credit card or bank details to the business's system, so that it is on file for future purchases. This process makes for a seamless experience for both your customer’s business as well as for their clients.",
